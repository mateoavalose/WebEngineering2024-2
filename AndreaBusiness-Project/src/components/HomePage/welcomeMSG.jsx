                Here, we don't play by the rules â€” we set them. My empire isn't just about flawless faces and fashion shows; 
                it's built on bold moves, unstoppable drive, and a little bit of chaos behind the scenes.</h3>
            <h3>Whether you're here for the makeup that defines your look, the models that bring it to life, or the world-class events that set the trends, 
                remember: this is a place where luxury meets danger, and only the fearless thrive.</h3>
            <h4>Take a look around. You might find more than you expected.</h4>
